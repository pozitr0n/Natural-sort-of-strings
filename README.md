Natural-sort-of-strings
=======================

Natural sorting is a simple and effective modification of merge sort, which takes into account that the data (or part thereof) may already be sorted. The gist of it is that you need to form a chain, and the merger would not produce them in a predetermined and fixed order and analyze available data in the array.
